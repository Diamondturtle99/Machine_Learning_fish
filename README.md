# Machine Learning fish

This is a simple project using Q-Learning to create moving dots 'fish' that attempt to get to the red 'food'.

**Setup**

All you have to do is run File.py make sure you have pygame and numpy installed.

*Note:*
*The blue fish was a lot dumber and gets stuck in the corners for me, so I increased the epsilon for the blue fish. Feel free to modify that if this is not the case for you*
